# MicroCourses LMS - Testing Guide

## Judge Check Scenarios

This document provides step-by-step instructions to verify all judge check requirements.

## Setup

1. Start the server:
```bash
node server.js
```

2. Verify health endpoint:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

Expected: `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}`

3. Verify manifest:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/.well-known/hackathon.json
```

Expected: `{"problem_id":4,"team_name":"...","contact_email":"..."}`

## Test Scenario 1: Creator Flow

### Step 1: Creator Applies (Registration)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "newcreator@test.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "name": "New Creator",

    "role": "creator"
  }
}
```

Save the token as `CREATOR_TOKEN`.

### Step 2: Creator Creates Course

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/courses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer CREATOR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: create-course-001" \

```

Save the course ID as `COURSE_ID`.

### Step 3: Creator Submits Course for Review

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/courses/2/submit \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer CREATOR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: submit-course-001"
```

**Expected Response**:

{
  "message": "Course submitted for review"
}
```

Verify status changed to "pending":
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/courses/2 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer CREATOR_TOKEN"
```

## Test Scenario 2: Admin Approval Flow

### Step 1: Admin Login

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "admin@test.com",

      ...
    }
  ],
  "next_offset": null
}
```

### Step 3: Admin Approves Course

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/courses/2/review \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: approve-course-001" \
  -d '{
    "status": "published"
  }'
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "Course published"
}
```

Verify course is now published:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/courses/2 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

Should show `"status": "published"`.

## Test Scenario 3: Learner Enrollment & Progress

### Step 1: Learner Login

```bash

**Expected Response**: Should include the published course.

### Step 3: Learner Enrolls in Course

Using the pre-seeded course (ID: 1):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/enrollments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer LEARNER_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: enroll-course-001" \
  -d '{
    "course_id": 1
  }'
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "Enrolled successfully",
  "course_id": 1
}
```

### Step 4: Get Course Lessons

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/courses/1/lessons \

      "video_url": "https://example.com/video1",
      "transcript": "Welcome to HTML Basics...",
      "order_index": 1
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Step 5: Complete Lesson 1

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/lessons/1/complete \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer LEARNER_TOKEN" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: complete-lesson-001"
```

**Expected Response**:

  -H "Authorization: Bearer LEARNER_TOKEN"
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "course_id": 1,
      "total_lessons": 3,
      "completed_lessons": [1],
      "progress_percentage": 33,
      "certificate_url": null
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 7: Complete Lesson 2

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/lessons/2/complete \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer LEARNER_TOKEN" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: complete-lesson-002"
```

### Step 8: Complete Lesson 3 (100% Progress)

```

**Certificate should be present** with a unique serial hash!

## Test Scenario 4: Pagination

### Test Course Pagination

```bash
# First page
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/courses?limit=1&offset=0" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer LEARNER_TOKEN"
```

**Expected**: 1 course with `"next_offset": 1`

```bash
# Second page
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/courses?limit=1&offset=1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer LEARNER_TOKEN"
```

**Expected**: Different course or `"next_offset": null` if no more courses.

### Test Lesson Pagination

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/courses/1/lessons?limit=2&offset=0" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer LEARNER_TOKEN"
```

**Expected**: 2 lessons with `"next_offset": 2`

## Test Scenario 5: Rate Limiting

### Trigger Rate Limit

Run this script to make 61 requests in quick succession:

```bash
TOKEN="LEARNER_TOKEN"

for i in {1..61}; do
  echo "Request $i"
  curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/courses \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
    > /dev/null
done

# 61st request should fail
curl http://localhost:3000/api/courses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

**Expected Response on 61st request**:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "RATE_LIMIT",
    "message": "Too many requests"
  }
}
```

HTTP Status: `429`

## Test Scenario 6: Idempotency

### Create Course Twice with Same Key

```bash
# First request
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/courses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer CREATOR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: duplicate-test-123" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Test Course",
    "description": "Testing idempotency"
  }'
```

Note the course ID in response.

```bash
# Second request with SAME KEY
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/courses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer CREATOR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: duplicate-test-123" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Test Course",
    "description": "Testing idempotency"
  }'
```

**Expected**: Identical response with same course ID. No duplicate created!

Verify:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/creator/courses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer CREATOR_TOKEN"
```

Should show only ONE "Test Course".

## Test Scenario 7: Error Handling

### Test Missing Required Field

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "password": "test123",
    "name": "Test"
  }'
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "FIELD_REQUIRED",
    "field": "email",
    "message": "Email is required"
  }
}
```

### Test Unauthorized Access

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/courses
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "UNAUTHORIZED",
    "message": "Authentication required"
  }
}
```

### Test Invalid Token

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/courses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid_token_123"
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "UNAUTHORIZED",
    "message": "Invalid token"
  }
}
```

### Test Forbidden Access (Role-Based)

```bash
# Learner trying to create course
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/courses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer LEARNER_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Forbidden Course",
    "description": "This should fail"
  }'
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "FORBIDDEN",
    "message": "Insufficient permissions"
  }
}
```

### Test Not Enrolled

```bash
# Try to complete lesson without enrollment
# First, create new learner
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "newlearner@test.com",
    "password": "pass123",
    "name": "New Learner",
    "role": "learner"
  }'
```

Save token, then:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/lessons/1/complete \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer NEW_LEARNER_TOKEN"
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "NOT_ENROLLED",
    "message": "Not enrolled in this course"
  }
}
```

## Test Scenario 8: RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

### Verify Learner Restrictions

```bash
# Learner cannot see draft courses
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/courses?status=draft" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer LEARNER_TOKEN"
```

**Expected**: Empty list or only published courses.

### Verify Creator Restrictions

```bash
# Creator cannot approve courses
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/courses/1/review \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer CREATOR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "published"}'
```

**Expected**: 403 Forbidden error.

### Verify Admin Privileges

```bash
# Admin can see all courses regardless of status
curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/courses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

**Expected**: All courses including drafts and pending.
